Some notes to accompany the 2013 mid-year update.  As the reference number reflect, the last time I 
fiddled with this stuff was 2010.  That effort was prompted by Java 5 and changes to Eclipse.
It would seem that I have forgot to document what I did to create the final project directories.

The project has 2 parts, the MOJO virtual machine and the ACP editor.  The main point of connection
between these parts is MASCOT XML project - this is the only project that is guaranteed to 
compile without other components.  The build scripts manage the build of other components.

The other shared components are the Images and ACPTemplates directories and the macp files.  MOJO-Demo
holds the definative versions of these files and other projects link to them
